# Maximum-Flow-Modelling-on-Network-Flow-Graph
This is a school project from Data Structures and Algorithms course where network flow graph, Dinic's Algorithm are used effectively.  It is an application of finding maximum flow on network flow  graphs. The aim of the project is make sure to supply as many flow from source to sink.
